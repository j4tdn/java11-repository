                    <p class="quote">What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile
                        without being a sports car.</p>
                    <p class="text">A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater,
                        two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and
                        nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times,
                        London in 1919. According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary,
                        USA's first known use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars
                        started to become popular during the 1920s.</p>
                    <p class="text">Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability
                        and light weight are requisite. Sports cars are usually
                        aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center
                        of gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension
                        are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.Traditionally
                        sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become
                        popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a
                        grand tourer is not absolute.</p>

                <article class="car-layout">
                    <h2 class="title">Seating layout</h2>
                    <p class="quote">Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</p>
                    <p class="text">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early
                        sporting regulations often demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often
                        produced by coachbuilders), two seats became common from about the mid-1920s.
                        Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often really only
                        suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to
                        as a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the
                        practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is
                        to place the driver's seat in the center of the car, which allows two full-sized
                        passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was
                        originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical because
                        of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their F1.
