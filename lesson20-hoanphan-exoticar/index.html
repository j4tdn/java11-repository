                <p style="font-size: 28px; line-height: 30px;">What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile
                    without being a sports car.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="line-height: 30px;">A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door
                    automobile designed for spirited
                    performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.
                    According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928. Sports
                    cars started to become popular during the 1920s.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p style="line-height: 30px;">Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and
                    light weight are requisite.
                    Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity
                    compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at
                    high speeds. Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become
                    popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not
                    absolute.

                <br>
                <div class="break"></div>
                <br>

                <p style="font-size: 28px; line-height: 30px; color: white;">Traditional sports cars were typically
                    two-seat roadsters.</p>

                <br>

                <p style="color: white; line-height: 30px;">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast
                    tourers, and early sporting regulations often
                    demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became
                    common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often
                    really only suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2
                    (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).
                </p>

                <br>

                <p style="color: white; line-height: 30px;">Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have
                    sought to increase the practicality of their
                    vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of
                    the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver.
                    The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical
                    because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their
                    F1.
