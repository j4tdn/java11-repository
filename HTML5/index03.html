        A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in 13th and 14th century Egypt,
        including a lemon juice drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat.[4] In 1676,
        a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in Paris.[5]

        While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767,
        the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in 1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment stalls.[6]
        R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since 1845.[7]

        <b id="vule">In France</b>, it is common for restaurants to offer citron pressé, an unmixed version of lemonade in which the customer is given lemon juice,
        syrup and water separately to be mixed in their preferred proportions.[21]

        Health effects
        The high concentration of citric acid in lemon juice is the basis for popular culture recommendations of consumption of lemonade to prevent calcium-based kidney stones. Studies have not demonstrated that lemonade causes a sustained improvement of urine pH, increased citric acid concentration in urine, reduction in supersaturation by stone-forming salts, or prevention of recurrent stones.[22]

        A popular variation of traditional lemonade, pink lemonade, is created by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated grape juice or dyes.[10]

        A 1912 obituary credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. "Sanchez" Allott, saying he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake.[11]

        Another origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother George Conklin tells the story in his 1921 memoir. According to the story,
        Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar and tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season. One day, he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting mixture as "strawberry lemonade" and saw his sales double.[10][12]
