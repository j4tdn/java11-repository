        <p>A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake 
            designed to be eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper 
            wrapper, and decorated with frosting on top.</p>

    <p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous
        Red Velvet Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with
         the natural ingredients make this little red rascal 
         unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla
          frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids
           as well.</p>
