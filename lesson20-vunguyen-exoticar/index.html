                        <i>What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.</i>
                    <p class="text1"> A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile
                                      designed for spirited performance
                                      and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.
                                      According to USA's Merriam-Webster
                                      dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to
                                      become popular during the 1920s.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text2">
                        Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are
                        requisite. Sports cars are
                        usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to
                        standard models.
                        Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds. Traditionally
                        sports cars were
                        open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the
                        distinction between a
                        sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.

                    <h1>Seating Layout</h1>
                    <p class="line"></p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</i>
                    <p class="text1">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting
                                     regulations often demanded four
                                     seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became
                                     common from about the mid-1920s.
                                     Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often really only
                                     suitable for luggage or small children;
                                     such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional"
                                     seats).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text2">
                        Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of
                        their vehicles by increasing the seating
                        room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the car, which allows two
                        full-sized passenger seats
                        on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered for the
                        Lamborghini Miura, but
                        abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle.
                        McLaren used the design
                        in their F1.
