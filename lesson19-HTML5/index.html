            A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in 13th and 14th century Egypt, including a lemon
            juice drink with sugar,
            known as qatarmizat.[4] In 1676, a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in Paris.[5]
            While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767,
            the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in 1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment
            stalls.[6]
            
            R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since 1845.[7]
            Pink lemonade
            A popular variation of traditional lemonade, pink lemonade, is created by adding additional fruit juices,
            flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated
            grape juice or dyes.[10]

            A 1912 obituary credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. "Sanchez" Allott, saying
            he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake.[11]

            Another origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother George Conklin tells
            the story in his 1921 memoir. According to the story, Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar and
            tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season. One day,
            he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to
            rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting
            mixture as "strawberry lemonade" and saw his sales double.[10][12]

            Clear lemonade

            The predominant form of lemonade in the UK, Ireland and Australia is a clear, lemon-flavoured carbonated
            beverage. Schweppes, R. White's Lemonade and C&C are common brands, and shops usually carry a store-branded
            lemonade as well.[7] Schweppes uses a blend of lemon and lime oils.[13] Other fizzy drinks, soft-drinks (or
            pop) which are both lemon and lime flavoured may also sometimes be referred to as lemonade, such as Sprite
            and 7 up. There are also speciality flavours, such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade, which is sold in the UK, the
            US, and Canada. Shandy, a mixture of beer and clear lemonade, is often sold pre-bottled, or ordered in
            pubs.[14]

            Brown lemonade
            There are various drinks called brown lemonade. In Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, brown lemonade
            is flavoured with brown sugar.[15] A variant from Venezuela has cane sugar and lime.[16]

            Other varieties
            In India and Pakistan, where it is commonly known as nimbu paani, and in Bangladesh, lemonades may also
            contain salt and/or ginger juice. Shikanjvi is a traditional lemonade from this region, and can also be
            flavored with saffron, cumin and other spices.[17][18][19]

            Limonana, a type of lemonade made from freshly squeezed lemon juice and mint leaves, is a common summer
            drink in the Middle East.[20] In Northern Africa, a drink called cherbat is made of lemon, mint, and rose
            water.[citation needed]

            Switcha is a version of the drink made in the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos that can also be made with limes
            instead of lemons.[citation needed]

            Citron pressé

            The French soft drink citron pressé, being diluted with water
            In France, it is common for restaurants to offer citron pressé, an unmixed version of lemonade in which the
            customer is given lemon juice, syrup and water separately to be mixed in their preferred proportions.[21]

            Cloudy lemonade
            Children operating a lemonade stand in La Cañada Flintridge, California, 1960
            The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India, cloudy lemonade,
            also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is non-carbonated and made with
            fresh lemon juice;
            however, commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also
            be served hot as a remedy
            for congestion and sore throats,[8] frozen, or used as a mixer.
            Traditionally, children in US and Canadian neighborhoods start lemonade stands to make money during the
            summer months.
            The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations on
            the concept exist across media.
            References can be found in comics and cartoons such as Peanuts, and the 1979 computer game Lemonade
            Stand.[9]
