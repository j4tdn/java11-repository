    <p>A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake
       designed to be eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper
       wrapper, and decorated with frosting on top.</p>

    <p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous
       Red Velvet Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with
       the natural ingredients make this little red rascal
       unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla
       frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids
       as well.</p>
